# Hostel Mess Menu Website

Welcome to the Hostel Mess Menu Website! This simple site was created to provide an easy way for hostel students to check the menu of different messes within the hostel premises. 

## About

This project was initiated during my first year of college as a fun way to apply my HTML skills. It serves as a practical tool for hostel residents to quickly access information about their daily meals without the hassle of physically checking the mess notice boards.

## Features

- **Easy Navigation:** Simple and intuitive user interface for effortless menu browsing.
- **Mess Selection:** Allows users to select their desired mess to view the menu.
- **Daily Updates:** Menu is regularly updated to reflect the latest meal offerings.

## Usage

To use the website, simply open the index.html file in any web browser. From there, select your hostel mess to view the current menu.

## Feedback

Feedback and suggestions for improvement are always welcome! Feel free to open an issue or reach out with any ideas or comments.

Happy dining!
